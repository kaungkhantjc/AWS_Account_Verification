# AWS Account Verification request 2

Dear AWS Verification Team,

My AWS account verification is on hold pending additional review. I used a Reloadable UAB Visa Prepaid Card from **UAB Bank** (Myanmar), which unfortunately doesn't provide a bank statement as **"No Bank Account Needed."** . It does not contain any name on the card.

To assist, I've provided my national ID card documents and my passport alongside the Reloadable UAB Visa Prepaid Card.

I'm pursuing a DevOps path and plan to use AWS services for my local and client projects. Please see my GitHub repos for validation.
