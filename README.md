# AWS Account Verification request

Dear AWS Verification Team,

My AWS account verification is on hold pending additional review. I used a Reloadable UAB Visa Prepaid Card from UAB Bank (Myanmar), which unfortunately doesn't provide a bank statement as **"No Bank Account Needed."**

To assist, I've provided my national ID card documents alongside the Visa card.

I'm pursuing a DevOps path and plan to use AWS services for my local and client projects. Please see my GitHub repos for validation.
